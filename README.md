## Description
This is a project based introduction to computer science study guide. The study guide will walk through important concepts like Objects, Constructors, Functions, If statements, If-else statments, Static vs. Non-Static, While loops, Arrays, For loops, ArrayLists, and basic graphics with processing.

*Important note: for the purposes of this study guide, there is no wrong answer as long as the code works. The code can be as messy, or inefficient as you'd like, as long as it makes sense to you, and works*
