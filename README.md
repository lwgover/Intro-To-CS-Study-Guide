# __Lucas's Intro to Computer Science Final Study Guide__

## Description
This is a project based introduction to computer science study guide. The study guide will walk through important concepts like objects, constructors, functions, if statements, if-else statments, static vs. non-Static, while loops, arrays, for loops, arrayLists, basic sorting algorithms and basic graphics with processing.

If you have any questions during the course of this study guide, feel free to reach out to me at _*lucasgover@gmail.com*_.

*Important note: for the purposes of this study guide, there is no wrong answer as long as the code works. The code can be as messy, or inefficient as you'd like, as long as it makes sense to you, and works. Have fun! make mistakes! try different approaches! These assignments are not graded, and are only for you to learn, so do whatever that looks like for you*

## Advice
- Try to switch windows and tabs as minimally as possible.
- It's really tempting to google (or ChatGPT) the answer, but you'll learn so much quicker and better if you struggle through it. If you really can't figure something out, try talking it out with a friend first!
- If you learn something new, physically write it down in your own words! this will dramatically improve your retention of the material
- Have fun with it! If you don't like the lesson, make your own!

## Downloading:
*If you'd like to easily access the prewritten code for this project, you can easily download this project by using the terminal app (it's really easy, I promise)*
- open the Terminal app, and paste this code `cd Desktop` then `git clone https://github.com/lwgover/Intro-To-CS-Study-Guide`

**it's possible this might not work on windows or linux machines. If this doesn't work, simply copy and paste the code manually*

Some parts of this project will use app __Processing__ to quickly visualize code.
For these sections, install `Processing` from [here](https://processing.org/download)

## Updates:

If this project is updated at any point while you're working your way through it, simply open the terminal app, paste `cd Desktop/Intro-To-CS-Study-Guide` then `git pull`
