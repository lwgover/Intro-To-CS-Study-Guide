### ü§ñ Make an Object!

1. In BlueJ, open the `Intro-To-CS-Study-Guide/1` project
2. create a class called [your name] (make sure the first letter is capitalized)
3. write 3 functions in this class:
```java
    public String getName(){} // this function will return your name.
    public void printName(){} // prints your name
    public String introduce(String otherPersonName){} // returns "Hi [other person's name], I'm [your name]"
```
4. fill in these functions, so that they do the stuff
