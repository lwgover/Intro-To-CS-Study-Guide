# Coding
### ü§ñ Make an Object!

1. In BlueJ, open the `Intro-To-CS-Study-Guide/1` project
2. create a class called [your name] (make sure the first letter is capitalized)
3. write 3 functions in this class:
```java
    public String getName(){} // this function will return your name.
    public void printName(){} // prints your name
    public String introduce(String otherPersonName){} // returns "Hi [other person's name], I'm [your name]"
```
4. fill in these functions, so that they do the stuff
5. make a java object by right clicking your class<br>

	![make object picture](./images/make_object.png)<br>
give it a name<br>
	![name object picture](./images/name_object.png)<br>
run your functions on the object!<br>
	![object picture](./images/object.png)<br>

6. now make a `Person` class. This class should have one field called name, and a constructor that sets the name
7. Add in all the functions from the [Your Name] class. Rewrite them to work with the `this.name` field
8. Add another `introduce` function, this time it should take the argument `otherPerson` which will have a type of `Person`. This function should introduce `this` person to the other person
<br>Example in the BlueJ codepad:```java
	>Person adam = new Person("Adam Alan Smith");
	>Person lucas = new Person("Lucas");
	>adam.introduce(Lucas);
	*Hi Lucas, I'm Adam Alan Smith*```
<br>Example with objects:
```	1. Create a Person object, with a name of instance as adam, and give it the name "Adam"
	2. Create a Person object, call it lucas, and give it the name "Lucas"
	3. right click on adam, and run the introduce function
	4. you should get a terminal pop up that says "Hi Lucas, I'm Adam"
```
