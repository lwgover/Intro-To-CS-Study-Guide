## 💡 Answers
1. An array is a data structure that stores an ordered collection of elements in a single variable of a specific data type. (your answer doesn't have to be this literal, but make sure to hit)
2. An ArrayList is a data structure that is similar to an array, but can dynamically change the size when elements are added or removed from it.
3. An array can be created by declaring a variable and assigning it a new array object with a given size: `int[] myArray = new int[size];`.
4. An ArrayList can be created by declaring a variable and assigning it a new ArrayList object: `ArrayList<Integer> myArrayList = new ArrayList<>();`. 
5. The main difference between an array and an ArrayList is that the size of an array is fixed, while an ArrayList can dynamically increase or decrease in size when elements are added or removed from it. Additionally, the elements of an array must all be of the same type, while an ArrayList may contain elements of different types.

## 📖 Notes on arrays
__Important:__ Arrays count starting at 0, not 1. The first element is 0, the second is 1, etc. Make sure you remember that!

If you're struggling with arrays, I think [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NptnmWvkbTw) video is really helpful! Generally everything done by The Coding Train is accessible and really informative. 

For me, it's helpful to think of arrays as numbered buckets,
